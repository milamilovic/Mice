# Nine men's morris

## About the game
Nine Men's Morris is a historical and strategic board game dating back to ancient times, with archaeological evidence suggesting that the game was played as early as 1400 BC. Also known as Merrills or Mill, the game is typically played on a square board with a unique pattern of lines that form a series of intersecting points.

The game starts with an empty board, and each player takes turns placing their pieces (commonly called "men") on the board. The objective is to form "mills," which are lines of three pieces along the board's lines, vertically or horizontally. Forming a mill allows the player to remove one of their opponent's pieces from the board, except when their opponent's pieces are in mills themselves. When a player is down to two pieces, they can "fly" or move their pieces to any empty spot on the board.

The game continues until one player is reduced to two pieces, making them unable to form a mill or block their opponent from forming a mill, thus losing the game. Alternatively, a player can lose by being unable to make a legal move on their turn. The game can also end in a draw if both players have no legal moves left.

Nine Men's Morris is a game of strategy and foresight, requiring players to anticipate their opponent's moves while simultaneously planning their own. It is a popular pastime in many cultures and has been played for centuries, illustrating its enduring appeal.
